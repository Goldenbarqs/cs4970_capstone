## Resources ##

Python language reference:

* [Official docs](http://docs.python.org/)
* [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Python) comparisons to other languages.

Django reference:

* [Django official site](http://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Official docs](http://docs.djangoproject.com/)

Sites built in Python/Django:

* [The Maneater](http://www.themaneater.com/)
* [The Spokesman-Review](http://www.spokesman.com/)

Other code libraries or APIs:

* [jQuery](http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page)
* [OpenLayers](http://trac.openlayers.org/wiki) ([example sites](http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/))
* [Mapnik](http://trac.mapnik.org/) ([example sites](http://mapnik.org/demo/))
* We should use [Google Chart API](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/) to render out fancy charts & graphs with <i>very little work</i>.
* And find a neat way to integrate [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) search.

## Prior art ##

*    [EveryBlock](http://everyblock.com/) is a fairly renowned web app that uses the same pieces as above (OpenLayers, Mapnik, Django, etc). [This article](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/takecontrolofyourmaps) discusses the rationale behind EveryBlock using the "stack" of PostGIS, Mapnik, TileCache, and OpenLayers.
*    [This Los Angeles Times mapping project](http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/) is a [Census data](http://factfinder.census.gov/home/saff/main.html)-powered Web app that does a little bit of what we want â€” we'll want to use more varied data than them, and on a national scale.
*    [Apps For America](http://www.sunlightlabs.com/contests/appsforamerica/) and [Apps For America 2](http://sunlightlabs.com/contests/appsforamerica2/) is a contest for sites built on [Data.gov](http://www.data.gov/)-supplied datasets. These are <b>all</b> open-source, though I don't think any of them use the same stack we do. Submitted apps for both contests are [here](http://www.sunlightlabs.com/contests/appsforamerica/apps/) and [here](http://sunlightlabs.com/contests/appsforamerica2/apps/).
*    Some folks at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have a bunch of their own resources at [their data.gov-centered wiki](http://data-gov.tw.rpi.edu/wiki/Main_Page).
